## About Me

I currently work at [Unseen Bio](https://unseenbio.com) where I build technology
to provide deeper insights into your personal gut microbiome. That means, I want
to predict how you can best **adjust your diet** to favour communities of
bacteria that are **beneficial to your health**.

As a bioinformatician, one of my guiding questions is, "How can I use my
knowledge of biological research and software development for the good of
humanity?"

This question leads to the following topics that I am very passionate about:

* Thinking in systems, both biological networks and software architecture.
* Designing automated solutions for and with human beings.
* Access to and transparency of knowledge as embodied by, for example, the open
  science movement or the open knowledge foundation.

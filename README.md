## About Me

As a bioinformatician, one of my guiding questions is, _"How can I use my
knowledge of biological research and software development for the good of
humanity?"_

This question leads me to the following topics that I am very passionate about:

* Thinking in systems, both biological networks and software architecture.
* Designing automated solutions for and with human beings.
* Access to and transparency of knowledge as embodied by, for example, the [open
  science movement](https://www.cos.io/) or the [Open Knowledge
  Foundation](https://okfn.org/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to
  name but a few.
